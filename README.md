## Overview:
Our project consists of making an android application that automatically captures pictures, names the object, and gives their location. This app is intended to help visually impaired people so that they can know what is in front of them by just opening the app. Our UI is made in a way that the user doesnâ€™t need to take pictures. The app itself is going to take pictures and analyze them every couple of seconds by default.

## How to Build:
Go to the misc folder, download the APK, and install the app on your phone. After installation, open the app, and everything should be working perfectly. This app can only be used on an Android smartphone that has a working camera.
